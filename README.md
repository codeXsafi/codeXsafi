## Hi there <img alt="wave" width="30" src="https://github.com/codeXsafi/codeXsafi/blob/main/wave.gif">

I'm <a href="https://www.safiullahahamed.com/">Safiullah Ahamed</a>, a passionate & qualified full-stack developer who is now completely into front-end development. I was born & raised in the tropical 🏝️ island of 🇱🇰SriLanka and currently exploring 🇲🇾Malaysia. My passion for software lies in dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take good care of the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.
